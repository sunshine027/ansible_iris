Contains Ansible playbooks for IRIS project

Playbook site.yml is used to deploy IRIS to prepared servers.
It assume that services such as apache and mysql already setup and config well.

This playbook uses common roles from infrastructure/ansible/roles repository:
- apache-mod: to enable mod_wsgi apache module

There are also 2 local iris-specific roles defined:
- iris-db: assume iris database is created and proper user exists
- iris-web: assume apache server is running and setup IRIS web service

Host names, passwords and other non-public data is in separate repos under
infrastructure/ansible/private/ with restricted access.

Vagrantfile defines a vm managed by vagrant for testing. It use Ansible
for provision, so when "vagrant up" you will get iris installed inside
that vm.

File "pptest" contains hosts definition for staging servers.

Playbook base.yml is used only for testing, since in testing environment, we
can't just assume mysql, apache are already setup, we have to setup them
ourselves as well.
